        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>While studying Criminology at Mississippi State University, I started working part time at an off campus textbook store. I stayed on after I graduated, and ended up working in the college textbook industry for the next decade, where a strong work ethic and the ability to work well with others brought me to DFW. As that industry is slowly dying, I figured it was a perfect time to change careers and pursue something I've always been interested in but could never find the time to practice: learning to code! So I enrolled in <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a> and never looked back!</p>
        <p>In my free time I love binge-watching TV shows and horror movies, or playing video games and Dungeons and Dragons.</p>
       <p>Favorite Horror Movies:</p>
        <!-- ordered list -->
        <ol>
          <li>Re-Animator</li>
          <li>Hereditary</li>
          <li>Anything for Jackson</li>
          <li>Terrifier</li>
          <li>Evil Dead</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I'm a huge nerd and proud of it!</p>
